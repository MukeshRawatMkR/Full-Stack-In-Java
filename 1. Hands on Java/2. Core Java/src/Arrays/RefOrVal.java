/*
When you pass an array to a method, whatâ€™s passed is the value of the reference (the memory address), not the actual array object.

Inside the method, both the caller and the callee refer to the same underlying array object, so modifications to elements reflect outside.

But if you reassign the parameter to a new array, that change does not affect the caller.
