//todo(Application of super keyword) -> https://chatgpt.com/c/68da611f-f5bc-832c-838c-27b0b7353433
//application of super keyword: super keyword is used to call parent constructor from the child class, if it is inherited from the parent class.

//todo(@override) -> https://chatgpt.com/c/68da640f-aba4-8330-8999-2fb1e84059c3
//overriding the method which is coming from the parent class.
//we can call parent class method even if we have overiden the method of parent class in our child class by using -> super keyword.
//eg: super.<parent-class-method>;



/*
Inheritance -> is-a relationship or has-a relationship.
we use inheritance only if there exists an is-a relationship between two classes.
Eg of is-a: SuperAdmin is a user
Surgeon is a doctor
Dog is an animal


Eg of has-a: car has a tyre.
but the inheritance we can apply only on is-a relationship.

/*
Protected access modifier:
Accessibility of field or method in subclasses.
 */


/*
Use of Inheritance:
1. Code reuseability
2. Method overriding -> runtime polymorphism.
 */

/*
Type of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance -> a single subclass extends from a single superclass.
2. Multilevel Inheritance -> digging.
3. *Hierarchal Inheritance -> level wise.
4. *Multiple Inheritance -> Papa and mummy to me.
it exits in cpp, python but not in java, we achieve it using Interfaces.
5. Hybrid Inheritance -> combination of two or more inheritances.
