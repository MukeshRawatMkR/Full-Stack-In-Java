public class AbstractClasses {


}

/*
Notes:
- can't be instantiated(can't create objects of abstract classes).
- and for abstract method it doesn't have method body.
- with the help of keyword -> abstract.
- E.g : abstract class class-name{

        }

        abstract void method();
- methods can also have abstract keyword.
- abstract class can have regular method and abstract method as well.
- if a abstract method exits in a class, that class must be a abstract as well.
- from abstract class we can make non-abstract subclass and that subclass can have objects instantiated.
